# SIVA
SIVA (short for super-intelligent voice assistant) is a voice assistant that performs a variety of tasks, as well as providing general information. Heavily inspired from Tony Stark's JARVIS tool.

# To-Do
✔️ code a barebones virtual assistant (ask question, get response)
- add a GPS location search tool for finding people, add callback to S.I.V.A. (Codename: Dot)
- add a Facial Recognition Tool that detects faces and converts it to names, add callback to S.I.V.A. (Codename: Adam)
- add Youtube search tool
- add Wakeword that triggers S.I.V.A.
- add way for S.I.V.A. to come up with answers for questions it doesn't know how to answer.
- add Duckduckgo search tool
- add Web Scraping tool that finds relevant data on a website related to query.
- Add recommendations for queries
- Add renaming feature for wakeword
- Prototype UI for S.I.V.A.
- Create a UI for S.I.V.A.
- add a 3D crime scene investigation and virtualization mode and callback to virtual assistant (Codename: Timelapse) 
- create a periodic table simulation and 3D Virtualization program for S.I.V.A. that could use AI and the three forms of matter to discover new elements (Codename: Chem-4)
- Work on making S.I.V.A. cross-platform
- Create 3D visualization and rendering framework for generating and rendering 3D models from a query. (i.e. render a mobius strip with start and endpoints from 2019 and 2020 with important events from both years, or render a klein bottle.) - (Codename: Vision)
- create a data server for S.I.V.A. as well as a backup on external storage
- work on IoT devices and impementing S.I.V.A. into the home. Voice-activated microwave, smart fridge, toaster, sandwich maker, air fryer, dish-washer, and eventually a voice-activated Tesla bot ;P
- Twitter hook to S.I.V.A. allowing user to tweet directly from S.I.V.A. 
- add Spotify hook in python: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32309322/how-can-i-play-a-spotify-audio-with-python
