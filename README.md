# SIVA
SIVA (short for super-intelligent voice assistant) is a voice assistant that performs a variety of tasks, as well as providing general information. Heavily inspired from Tony Stark's JARVIS tool.

It is the god of all OSINT (OPEN-SOURCE INTELLIGENCE NATIONAL TREASURE).

Ask it anything, and it can do it.
